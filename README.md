# Poets
[Poets from the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poets_from_the_United_States) scraped from wikipedia (poets.py). Maps created with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). I geocoded what I could, scriptwise, for place of birth and place of death. Not everyone has personal history data in wiki infobox. Project idea....

## apps
 * Interactive [cluster map](http://slackerdesign.com/poets/index.html)
* [Time slider](http://slackerdesign.com/poets/poet_timeslider.html) - Place of birth, time distributed
  
## gis
