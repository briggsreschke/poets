# Poets
[Poets from around the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poets) and [Poets from the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poets_from_the_United_States) scraped from wikipedia (poets_scrape.py). Maps created with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/). I geocoded what I could, scriptwise, for place of birth and place of death. Not everyone has personal history data in wiki infobox. Project idea...
